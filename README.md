# hello-world
welcome humans
I'm a security integrator. I mainly work about 40% in a sales role and 60% in an install and management role. I love to work with electronics as a direct result of the technology Im constantly exposed to in my work environment. I work with intrusion, cctv, access control, sound, intercoms and smart homes on a professional level and diy arduino, raspberry pi's on an amatuer level.
